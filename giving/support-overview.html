                <br>
                <p>The spirit of giving is expressed every day throughout CES. Many generous people make a Christ Episcopal School education possible, whether they're volunteering in the classroom or library, serving on a CESPA or Art at the Park Committee, supporting the Annual Fund or Capital Fundraising or serving on the Board of Trustees. Thanks to the voluntary support of our school community, Christ Episcopal School has been able to shape and expand its excellent academic program, recruit and retain quality teachers, keep ahead of the curve on technology in education and develop a unique campus learning environment.</p>
                <p>You can support the Christ Episcopal School by volunteering time and talents or by contributing financially. Volunteering can be high-commitment or low-profile. The ways in which you can financially support C.E.S. are varied and rewarding. Various giving options fit individual philanthropic and financial planning needs. Since Christ Episcopal School was established in 1984, the tradition of giving has been an important ingredient which has allowed the school to grow and flourish. The advancement of the school continues to depend upon that tradition of giving as families, faculty, staff, alumni and friends support the school in various ways. Your support benefits the students of today and tomorrow, affirming the day to day as well as future success of the school's mission.</p>
                <p>Gifts allow the school to start new programs and help strengthen existing ones. Gifts make financial aid available to qualified boys and girls and promote and reward the work and dedication of our dedicated faculty and staff. Your gifts provide professional development, technology improvements, curricular improvements, athletic activities, fine arts opportunities, and various student enrichments. Participation by the entire Christ Episcopal School community is the key to our continued success. We invite you to get involved!</p>
                <p>Christ Episcopal School is a mission of Christ Church, Covington and has 501(c)3 status under the Group Exemption letter for the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana. This means that gifts to the school are deductible for federal income tax purposes.</p>
