                <h5>Gifts of Cash</h5>
                <p>Monetary donations are greatly appreciated! The easiest way to give is by check or to use our online form with your MasterCard or Visa, credit or debit card. You may also use your credit card by calling Suzanne Freret, at
                    <a href="tel://1-985-871-9902">985-871-9902</a>&nbsp;ext. 281. When giving via check, please make it payable to Christ Episcopal School, and mail to:

                <h5>Gifts of Securities</h5>
                <p>Gifts of appreciated stock or mutual funds can provide you with important tax advantages. When you donate appreciated securities, capital gains tax does not apply if you have held them for more than 18 months. In addition, you can receive an income tax deduction for part of the gift. It is recommended that you not give depreciated stock, as it will most likely result in a tax disadvantage to you; instead, sell stock worth less than when you bought it for a tax loss and then donate the proceeds to Christ Episcopal School. Check with your tax advisor before making a donation of securities. Click here for detailed instructions for Stock Transfers.</p>

                <h5>Corporate Matching Gifts</h5>
                <p>Before making a gift to Christ Episcopal School, check with your employer to see if they will match a portion or all of your donation. This could allow you to double your gift to the school.</p>
