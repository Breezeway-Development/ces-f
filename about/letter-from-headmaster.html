                    <br>We water the seeds already planted, knowing that they hold future promise.
                    <br>We lay foundations that will need further development.
                    <br>We provide yeast that produces effects far beyond our capability.

                    <br>We are workers, not master builders; Ministers, not messiahs.

                <p>Just as they did in 1994, 2002, and again in 2008, our Board of Trustees is engaged in the development of a new Strategic Plan for Christ Episcopal School. This new plan will serve as road map for our Board and Administration for the next five years, as we navigate the curves and obstacles in the long and winding road set before us.</p>
                <p>We are confronted today with the challenges of an emerging high school program, the need to expand and improve facilities to serve students on both campuses, the challenges of ever-changing educational trends and curricula, and the demands of the increasing impact of technology in the lives of our students. And those are the just challenges we know are coming. History has taught us -- just as Archbishop Romero suggests -- that we are "prophets of a future" we simply cannot predict. Our job here is to be prepared and to do our best to develop strategies which address the most important issues facing us today.
                </p>
                <p>In order to do that most effectively, the Board has decided upon a planning procedure that will take seven months to complete. The initial organizational and information-gathering meeting took place in November, and the process ahead will include surveys of parents, students, faculty, and general public, the creation of focus groups, and the conducting of individual interviews. All will culminate with a multi-day Charrette in April, an event which will give an opportunity to all of our constituencies to provide input. The Strategic Plan process adopted by our Board is ambitious, comprehensive, and collaborative. We will be led by a team of experienced, qualified facilitators who are committed to a transparent and disciplined process. By May, the Board of Trustees will unveil a new Strategic Plan for 2014 and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>Each of you will be asked to participate in this process. We ask that you respond to surveys in a timely manner, and if you care to participate in Focus Group discussions or interviews, please let us know. Our intention is to listen to as many people as we reasonably can and to have our new Strategic Plan honestly reflect the vision and priorities of the families we serve. We believe our new Strategic Plan will provide us direction, encouragement, and enthusiasm as we gather to celebrate the school's 30th birthday in August.
                </p>
                <p>I thank you most sincerely for your faith and trust in us as we proceed with this challenging and important venture. And I pray that God will continue to bless and protect our school as we Act Justly, Instill Peace, and Imitate Christ in renewing our commitment to fulfill the mission of Christ Episcopal School.
