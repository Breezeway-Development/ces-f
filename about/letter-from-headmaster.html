                <p>Two long-term projects which hold great significance for the future Christ Episcopal School have reached important milestones this summer. We've been working on both projects for well over a year now, and as Henry Ford suggests, success has certainly been the outcome of our coming together, keeping together, and working together.</p>
                <p>The first is our effort to build a new facility on the CBC campus to address two important and urgent needs. This school has long been in need of an adequate facility to support the performing and visual arts at CES. Our expanding music program, our award-winning choir program, and our acclaimed theater program have all been limited by the lack of adequate facilities. The new theater within the Center of Inquiry will address those needs, as well as provide additional classrooms, offices, conferences rooms, and library for the expanding high school program. And as of this writing, we are very close to breaking ground. The initial phase of our fund raising goals has been met, contractors have been chosen, final construction documents are being prepared, and the footprint of the building has been staked out. The new building represents a bold statement of commitment to the future of CES, and the Board of Trustees has worked tirelessly to bring us to point. We expect construction to start before the new school year begins.</p>
                <p>The second project is the preparation of our Self Study documents in anticipation of our ISAS accreditation visit in the fall. Under the leadership of Mrs. Molly Heurtin and our division heads, faculty and Board committees have thoroughly and critically examined our goals and philosophy, our curricular and extra-curricular programs, our governance model, our admissions procedures, our financial and business operations, and our facility needs. The result of our labors is a series of comprehensive documents which will be presented to the members of the ISAS Visitation Committee in September. The committee will then appraise the validity of the documents and assess our plans and priorities for the future.</p>
                <p>So as we enjoy some measure of contentment in the progress we have made, we look forward to the challenges still before us. Much has yet to be accomplished before the Center of Inquiry rises off the ground, and our efforts to prepare for the ISAS visitation will continue, no doubt, until the moment we welcome the committee to our campus on September 30. Great progress, certainly, but the best is yet to come.</p>
