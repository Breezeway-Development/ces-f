                <p>Christ Episcopal School is a parish day school, created in 1984 as an outreach ministry of Christ Church in Covington, Louisiana. It exists as a part of Christ Episcopal Church (www.christchurchcovington.com), which is incorporated as a non-profit organization. The highest level of decision-making authority resides in the volunteer Board of Trustees. This Board is approved by the Vestry of the Church and is charged with, but not limited to: developing basic policies for the school; carrying out continuous evaluation of the school; ensuring that the finances of the school are administered in a fiscally responsible manner; reporting on a regular basis to the Vestry; adhering to all policies of Christ Episcopal Church and the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana; and keeping an accurate record of all its proceedings.</p>
                <p>There are a maximum of sixteen members of the Board, of which one is non-voting (the Headmaster). Twelve members are appointed for three-year terms, with one third rotating off each year. Other members include the Rector of the Church, a Vestry representative and a CESPA representative. There are four standing committees of the Board: Executive, Nominating, Finance and Development Planning. Other ad hoc committees are formed as needed.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Nomination of Board Members</h5>
                <p>Members of the Board are chosen through an annual nomination process. The Nominating Committee is composed of the Rector, the Vestry member of the Board and three other members of the Board. The Board as a whole is solicited for additional names. The Nominating Committee generates a list of names of possible new Board members and meets to discuss. Candidates for Board membership are canvassed with regard to their willingness to serve. The entire Board reviews the work of the Committee. The Nominating Committee then establishes a slate of candidates, one for each opening, which is then presented to the Vestry of Christ Church for appointment. Biographies of the candidates are provided to the Vestry as part of this process. Orientation takes place at the initial Board meeting of the new school year. Copies of all documents relating to the school are provided to new board members.</p>

                <h5>The Board's Link to the School: The Headmaster</h5>
                <p>The Headmaster is hired by the Board to run the school. The Headmaster has the responsibility of carrying out the policies of the Board of Trustees, managing the operational and financial aspects of the school on a day-to-day basis, hiring and supervising faculty and staff, and overseeing the various programs of the school. It is also the Headmaster's responsibility to provide a vision for the future in order to lead the school toward its goals.</p>
                <p>The Headmaster reports to the Board of Trustees through monthly reports, attendance at monthly meetings, Board membership, and participation on various Board sub-committees. Within that group, he has direct and frequent contact with the chairperson and should circumstances warrant, the Executive Committee. The Headmaster, along with the Vestry representative on the Board of Trustees, also keeps the Vestry apprised of school developments through monthly reports and is available to the Vestry at their monthly meetings.</p>
