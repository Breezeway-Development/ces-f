                    <p>Note: The fees listed below are based on the 2013-14 school year. Tuition is determined on an annual basis in January by the Board of Trustees. Tuition typically increases between 3%-5%. Each family is assessed a $425 facilities maintenance fee and $175 per student technology fee.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>8th - $9,200</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Once a student is notified, an enrollment contract will be issued. The $350 ($150 if applying for financial aid) non-refundable registration deposit (which is part of the tuition) and the signed contract are due two weeks after the acceptance date. The signed contract and registration deposit guarantee the applicant a place in next year's class. Parental obligation is irrevocable effective June 15th unless notification is received in writing prior to that date.</p>
