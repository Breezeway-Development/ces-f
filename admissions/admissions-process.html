                    <br />
                    <h5>How does the admission process begin?</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, contact the admission office (985/871-9902, extension 208) to request a packet of information or to set up a tour of the school. You may also visit the school's website, www.christepiscopalschool.org to download an application or request information. Complete the Application for Admission and return it to the Admission Office with a non-refundable, $100.00 fee. Applications for the following school year, particularly at the kindergarten and pre-kindergarten levels, should be received in the school office by November 1st.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Once the application is completed and returned to the school, what is the next step?</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will receive a written acknowledgment of your application.</li>
                        <li>In early January of the school year of entry, play group visits will be scheduled for pre-kindergarten applicants. This visit provides an opportunity for pre-kindergarten teachers to see how the children interact with each other and to determine placement in either our pre-kindergarten or young four-year-old program. Kindergarten applicants are scheduled for a screening in January to determine their developmental maturity. This screening is conducted by a trained examiner who utilizes The Gesell Developmental Observation, a respected assessment tool. The cost of the screening is $70 and due on the day of screening.</li>
                        <li>First grade applicants are scheduled to meet with the Lower School Division Head who performs a readiness assessment.</li>
                        <li>Class visits for applicants in grades 2-7 are scheduled only when space permits. If the class visit is successful, transcripts are requested and teacher recommendation form(s) are forwarded to the student's current school.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>How many students are enrolled in each class?</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-kindergarten consists of two levels based on developmental maturity. Once the children are screened, they are placed in either the pre-kindergarten level (three sections consisting of 16-16-12 students) or young four-year-old level (one section consisting of 10 students).</li>
                        <li>Kindergarten consists of three sections, each with 17 students.</li>
                        <li>Grades 1- 4 consist of three sections of each grade, typically with 18 students per section. Extra personnel are assigned at various levels to provide more individualized attention during these critical developmental years.</li>
                        <li>Grades 5-7 consist of three homeroom sections of each grade with no more than 20 students per homeroom. Schedules are designed to group students according to ability in math and language so the population varies at each subject level.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>How many students are typically admitted to each grade?</h5>
                    <p>The most common entry point for an applicant is pre-kindergarten. Generally speaking, if all young four-year-olds re-enroll and move to pre-kindergarten, ten seats are open at the young-four level and thirty-four seats are available in pre-kindergarten. If all pre-kindergarten students progress to kindergarten, there are approximately seven seats available to new students in kindergarten. First grade typically has three seats and availability in grades 2-7 is based on space created by student vacancies. In all cases, the most important factor is the match between the school and the applicant.</p>

                    <h5>Is there a priority selection process for admissions?</h5>
                    <p>The school is committed to enrolling a diverse and balanced student body. We welcome students of all races, creeds, national or ethnic origins. Our first consideration is to ensure that every student admitted is capable of handling a rigorous academic curriculum happily and successfully. If all other factors are equal, we do give some consideration to families with previous ties to Christ Episcopal School or Church.</p>

                    <h5>What is the notification process?</h5>
                    <p>The Board of Trustees set tuition for the following school year at their January meeting. Contracts for returning students are then mailed with a mid-February due date. As soon as we are able to determine availability at various grade levels, we move forward with the admission process by setting up the prescribed screening procedures. New students are advised of acceptance via telephone contact with the parent/guardian. An enrollment contract is then issued with a two week window to return the document along with a $350 registration fee ($150 if applying for Financial Aid). Pre-kindergarten and kindergarten applicants receive notification of acceptance once all candidates are screened which is typically by mid-February.</p>

                    <h5>What if my child qualifies for admission but space is not available?</h5>
                    <p>Your child will be placed on a "wait list." As openings develop, the wait list candidates are contacted to determine continued interest. Because vacancies can develop unexpectedly, acceptances sometimes occur even as late as the end of August.</p>

                    <h5>How much is your annual tuition? (2014-15 school year)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-kindergarten - $7,025</li>
                        <li>Kindergarten through 7th - $8,850</li>
                        <li>8th - $9,200</li>
                        <li>HS - $10,650</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please note that tuition usually increases between 3%-5% annually. Each family is assessed a $425 facilities maintenance fee and each student in grades 1st-12th is assessed a $175 technology fee.</p>

                    <h5>When is tuition due?</h5>
                    <p>Once the contract is signed, parental obligation is irrevocable effective June 15 unless prior to that date the school is notified in writing of the student's withdrawal. The school offers optional tuition refund insurance through Dewar. Information regarding the insurance program is provided at registration.
                        <br />The Board of Trustees offers three payment options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tuition is due in full by July 1</li>
                        <li>60% due by July 1, 40% due by November 1</li>
                        <li>Ten tuition payments July-April</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Do you offer financial aid?</h5>
                    <p>Financial aid is awarded on the basis of demonstrated financial need. The school uses FACTS Grant & Aid Assessment as a means of obtaining an objective analysis of each family's financial need. Award decisions are not made by FACTS as they simply provide us with data in order to fairly distribute financial aid awards. The school has a small, confidential committee which reviews the assessment figures provided by FACTS in order to provide tuition grants to as many students as we can. Families wishing to apply for financial aid should indicate that on the back of the application for admission. Families applying for financial aid will need to complete an application and submit the necessary supporting documentation to FACTS Grant & Aid Assessment by a specific date. To keep the cost down for all applicants, paper applications are not available. If assistance is needed, you should contact the business office as soon as possible. Applicants may apply online beginning in mid-January of the upcoming year at www.factstuitionaid.com . All deadlines must be adhered to, as financial aid is available on a limited basis. Typically, no student is awarded assistance in excess of 50% of the total tuition; however, exceptions have been made on a case by case basis. All consideration of financial aid is kept confidential and does not affect how a student is considered in the application process. Students who receive financial aid are required to re-apply each year. Renewal of aid is based on proof of continued financial need. In the case of divorced or separated parents, the incomes of both biological parents and stepparents are considered. Being admitted does not guarantee financial aid.
